# -Audiology---Classifying-2-types-of-hearing-disorders-with-a-Shallow-Neuroph-Neural-Network
To implement a shallow neural network (also known as a single hidden layer neural network) to classify two types of hearing disorders using the Neuroph library, we need a dataset that represents hearing disorders, such as audiometric test results or features derived from audio signals. Since the dataset isn't explicitly provided in your request, I will assume that you have some basic data (such as two classes of hearing disorders with various features) to work with.
What is Neuroph?

Neuroph is a Java-based framework for creating and training neural networks. It provides a simple API for building, training, and deploying neural networks. Here we will create a shallow neural network using Neuroph for classifying hearing disorders.
Assumptions:

    We have a dataset where each instance has features related to hearing (e.g., frequency thresholds, speech recognition scores, etc.).
    Our dataset is pre-processed and split into training and test datasets.

Steps:

    Install Neuroph: First, you need to include the Neuroph library in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.neuroph</groupId>
        <artifactId>neuroph-core</artifactId>
        <version>2.9</version>
    </dependency>

    Create the Neural Network: Set up a shallow neural network with one hidden layer for classification.

    Train the Neural Network: Train the neural network on your dataset.

    Test the Model: Evaluate the model on test data.

Example Code

Here is an example code to set up and train a shallow neural network for classifying hearing disorders using Neuroph.

import org.neuroph.core.Neuron;
import org.neuroph.core.Layer;
import org.neuroph.util.NeuronProperties;
import org.neuroph.util.NeuronProperties;
import org.neuroph.core.input.WeightedSum;
import org.neuroph.core.input.WeightedSum;
import org.neuroph.core.NeuronProperties;

public class HearingDisorderClassifier {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the number of input and output neurons
        int inputSize = 5; // Example: Number of features (adjust based on your dataset)
        int outputSize = 2; // For 2 classes (e.g., "Normal" and "Hearing Impairment")

        // Create a shallow neural network with one hidden layer
        MultiLayerPerceptron neuralNet = new MultiLayerPerceptron(inputSize, 3, outputSize); // Hidden layer with 3 neurons

        // Prepare your dataset (this is just an example)
        // Assume X_train and y_train are your training data and labels
        double[][] trainingData = {
            {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, // Example feature set 1
            {15, 25, 35, 45, 55}, // Example feature set 2
            {12, 22, 32, 42, 52}, // Example feature set 3
            {20, 30, 40, 50, 60}  // Example feature set 4
        };
        
        double[][] trainingLabels = {
            {1, 0},  // Class "Normal"
            {1, 0},  // Class "Normal"
            {0, 1},  // Class "Hearing Impairment"
            {0, 1}   // Class "Hearing Impairment"
        };

        // Convert your data to Input and Output instances
        DataSet trainingSet = new DataSet(inputSize, outputSize);
        for (int i = 0; i < trainingData.length; i++) {
            trainingSet.addRow(trainingData[i], trainingLabels[i]);
        }

        // Train the neural network with the dataset
        neuralNet.learn(trainingSet);

        // Test the trained model
        testModel(neuralNet);
    }

    public static void testModel(NeuralNetwork neuralNet) {
        // Example of testing with a new input (this input should be normalized)
        double[] testInput = {12, 22, 32, 42, 52}; // New test data (example)
        
        // Set the input for the network and calculate the output
        neuralNet.setInput(testInput);
        neuralNet.calculate();

        // Get the output of the neural network
        double[] output = neuralNet.getOutput();

        // Output interpretation: for 2-class classification
        if (output[0] > output[1]) {
            System.out.println("Prediction: Normal Hearing");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Prediction: Hearing Impairment");
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

    Input Layer: The number of input neurons corresponds to the number of features in your dataset (e.g., hearing test parameters).
    Hidden Layer: A shallow network here uses a single hidden layer. I've chosen 3 neurons arbitrarily, but you can experiment with different sizes.
    Output Layer: The output layer has two neurons for binary classification (e.g., normal hearing and hearing impairment).
    Training Data: The trainingData matrix holds the feature set, and trainingLabels holds the corresponding class labels (e.g., [1, 0] for normal hearing and [0, 1] for hearing impairment).
    Learning: The learn() method trains the neural network using the provided dataset.
    Testing: After training, the network is tested using a new data point to predict the class.

Dataset:

For real applications, the dataset should consist of preprocessed audiological data, such as:

    Frequency Thresholds: The softest sound the person can hear at various frequencies.
    Speech Recognition Scores: How well the person recognizes speech in various conditions.
    Pure Tone Audiometry results (if available).

The dataset should be pre-processed (e.g., normalization or standardization) for better results with the neural network.
Notes:

    Data Preprocessing: Ensure that your data is pre-processed correctly. This may involve normalizing numerical values and ensuring that categorical data is encoded properly.
    Validation: To improve the modelâ€™s performance, consider using cross-validation or testing with a separate dataset.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: The number of neurons in the hidden layer, learning rate, and other hyperparameters can be tuned to improve accuracy.

Conclusion:

This code demonstrates how to classify hearing disorders using a shallow neural network in Java with the Neuroph library. By using proper audiometric features and training the network on a suitable dataset, you can train the model to classify hearing disorders accurately.
